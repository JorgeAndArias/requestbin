# RequestBin

RequestBin is a tool that allows you to capture, log, and inspect HTTP requests sent to a public API endpoint.

## Features

- Create unique request bins.
- Each bin has two unique URLs:
  - An endpoint for receiving requests.
  - A front-end URL for viewing received requests.
- You can:
  - view details of captured requests, including:
    - HTTP method
    - Path
    - Headers
    - Body
  - See a list of all requests made to a bin.
  - Click on a request in the list to view its full details.

### Implementation Details

- Front-end is a single-page web app built with React + TypeScript + [vite](https://vite.dev/) and [material ui](https://mui.com/).
- Back-end is implemented with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
- Bin and request metadata are stored in PostgreSQL.
- Request payload data is stored in MongoDB.
- State persistence is implemented via browser local storage, allowing users to access the same bins across sessions.

## Requirements

In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file with the following contents:

  ```env
  # PostgreSQL configuration
  PGHOST=localhost
  PGDATABASE=requestbin
  PGPORT=5432           # Default PostgreSQL port
  PGUSER=postgres       # Replace with your PostgreSQL username
  PGPASSWORD=postgres   # Replace with your PostgreSQL password

  # MongoDB configuration
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017 # Default MongoDB URI

  # Application port
  PORT=3000             # Port the backend server will run on
  ```

ðŸ’¡**Note:** Ensure that PostgreSQL and MongoDB are installed and running locally with the above credentials. You may need to adjust these values to match your environment.

## Installation

Navigate to the `backend` directory and build the full project

  ```bash
  cd backend && npm run build:full
  ```

Start the application

  ```bash
